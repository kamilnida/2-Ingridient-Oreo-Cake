This is a simple recipe to make for yourself and your family which only takes 2 minutes and tastes really good. The taste might be similar to a normal oreo biscuit but it is meant to be taste like that since it is only made up of 2 ingridients, however you can add flour and eggs or whatever else needed in order to make a proper cake.
